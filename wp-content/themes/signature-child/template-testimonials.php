				<p class="quote">Brian showed up on time and cleaned all of the windows inside and out. He did a terrific job and left some windows better than new. We would definitely use him again.</p>

				<p class="quote">Brian was the mid-priced of three bids but we chose him because we liked the way he represented himself and his work. We were not disappointed! He arrived exactly on time, was well equipped, obviously experienced, used an eco-friendly cleaning solution and worked diligently for eleven hours, including a lunch break. He is a gracious, friendly, bright and conscientious young man. Our windows have never looked better!</p>

				<p class="quote">I bought my house two years ago and it’s been my dream to get my windows cleaned from top to bottom; they looked as if they have never been touched. I found Brian on Angie’s List (go Angie’s) and called him for a brief estimate; Brian quoted me 200-some dollars for 12 windows. What a great price! Brian also had an opening right away. Brian showed up on time and got to work asap. The first thing I noticed is that Brian REALLY is thorough in what he does: No quick rinse or fast wipe. He really makes sure that everything in the house that’s glass gets a very, very good cleaning. My windows have storms and screens. So that means that *8* surfaces need to be cleaned and that excludes the screens. Brian had to use the scraper on most of my windows to get off the dirt, and he also cleaned my screens. WOW!!! What also impressed me big time is this: I made the mistake and counted only the windows on my first floor. Brian did not mind at all and cleaned the eight windows on my second floor as well and on the same day. That, of course, meant a LONG day. Brian worked a total of 12 straight hours cleaning my windows. WOW again!!! I should also add this: Brian is SUPER pleasant to be around. At times I completely forgot that he’s even there. Later in the day we chatted a bit and it was just such a pleasure. Brian also showed me a thing or two about my windows. What a nice guy! The end result is amazing. I can’t stop marveling at my windows. My house looks completely different. It truly sparkles thanks to Brian’s work. I will for SURE keep hiring Brian next year. His window cleaning ability is worth every dime!!!!</p>

				<p class="quote">Brian quickly responded to our request for an estimate and scheduled the work within a week of the initial estimate. His estimate was very reasonable for the size of the job. He arrived on time, worked quietly and professionally. I even forgot he was here at times. The work was thorough and immaculate. This was the best cleaning job we have had. When rain interrupted the exterior work, Brian came back the next day to complete the job. We most highly recommend Signature Window Cleaning.</p>

				<p class="quote">Brian did a great job – very professional. This was my first experience with using a company to clean my windows – they look awesome and I won’t hesitate to use this company again. He also did a few extras for me such as cleaning out some gutters I couldn’t get to.</p>

				<p class="quote">Brian gave us a bid for each floor separately as we requested and scheduled the work quickly and as we needed. He arrived promptly and performed and completed the work in an exemplary, professional manner. He’s is a quiet gentleman. I am disabled and felt comfortable leaving him in our house while I ran out on an errand and when I later took a nap. Nice guy. Great experience! What a difference clean windows make!</p>

				<p class="quote">I was very happy with their service. I booked them several months in advance, as I knew that I wanted them to come right away in the Spring. They came when they said they would (8:00 a.m.), and they diligently worked through the inside of the house first, followed by the outside. They were polite, quiet, and did precisely the job I hired them to do with no issues whatsoever. I was very happy with the job they did and the price they quoted. There were no surprises. I look forward to working with them again next year! :)</p>

				<p class="quote">They did a phenomenal job. Our windows were filthy from street construction. They are worth every penny spent for a high quality job. I have had others do a cheaper job but I got what I paid for in terms of quality of job and professionalism of the people on the job. This was a very hard job because windows were old and stuck in hard to get to places. They were on time, on budget and very easy to have a round. I would never use anyone else do to the job.</p>

				<p class="quote">Brian came out the same day I called for an estimate. He worked around my schedule, and was very detailed and professional. We set up the cleaning for about a week later. Brian and another cleaner were on time, and did an excellent job. Every window looks great, they were careful, and they cleaned up well. No sign they were there, except for very clean windows. Excellent service, I will definitely use them again.</p>

				<p class="quote">Very positive response to initial call, very friendly and professional. Punctual on scheduled date and spent a lot of time very thoroughly cleaning all the windows. Brian even asked to come inside and clean the inside of one particularly dirty window (at no extra charge). He really prides himself in his work and does an excellent job!</p>

				<p class="quote">Brian returned our initial call timely and was able to come out to provide an estimate the following day. His price was higher than what we have paid other window cleaners in the past however his level of service was also higher (as it included the screens and sills) and the price was still reasonable. We scheduled a time for the following week to have the cleaning performed. They arrived promptly and were polite and respectful. The windows look great inside and out and the work was completed professionally. I am glad we hired Signature Window Cleaning and I would hire them again.</p>

				<p class="quote">Brian was prompt in his estimate and also very fair considering the extreme dirtiness of the windows (we’d moved in recently and it was clear the windows hadn’t been cleaned in years!) Also, our windows are original to our 1920’s home and have hundreds of small panes. Brian scheduled about a day and a half to do all of the work, and did a very meticulous job and had a great attitude of customer service and flexibility around my schedule and requests. He was more reasonable in cost than 2 other contractors I got estimates from, and probably spent more time since the others thought they would spend only a day.</p>

				<p class="quote">We’ve used Signature Widow Cleaning before and would strongly recommend them. I had just had my carpet cleaned, and they were extra careful about working in that area. They use tarps under where they work. They are very efficient and tidy. The windows gleam after they do their work.</p>

				<p class="quote">Fantastic! My wife thought our windows would never get clean because the glass is 60-70 years old. Brian really shocked us with how clean the windows were. It is really hard to believe how well he did. He is a nice guy – very responsible and careful with his work. We would [will] hire him again. We have had our windows done several times before – but never with results like this.</p>

				<p class="quote">Brian responded promptly to my email request and came the next day to give an estimate. His manor was low key and friendly. He looked around carefully before giving the written estimate. He was available within a couple days, arrived on time and did an amazing job. He was meticulous and even able to make our laundry room window shine even though an overgrown bush was very much in his way. He was neat and a very hard worker.</p>
